This bug is CVE-2016-2383 but implemented on the latest stable kernel.
The verifier is doing patches all the time to our bpf program to not go oob or do something suspicious, when doing backward jump (you can do it in BPF program) it will not take in consideration the new added instructions, and it will do the exact offset jump after the program is completely patched. (not a correct jump after the insn expanded)
