The challenge description was something along these lines:

```
We fixed last year's bug in r2 kernel socks, and while at it made a few small 
changes and added a very wanted feature.

Can you still root the server?
```

Thus the objective is to write an exploit to obtain root privileges on the 
provided VM.
